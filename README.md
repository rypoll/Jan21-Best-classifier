# Jan21-Best-classifier

This project was part of a marked assignment during my MSc in Statistics.

The aim of the project  is to find the best classifying algorithm for a given data set.

The data set consists of simulated data on high energy gamma particles in an atmospheric Cherenkov telescope, extracted from extracted from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope data set.

As particles pass through the telescope, a shower of electromagnetic radiation is produced, which are approximated by elliptical shapes. The goal is to distinguish the showers which arise from gamma particles from those which come from hadrons. The data has 11 columns, 10 continuous variables in the first 10 columns, and a class label, g or h, in the final column.
